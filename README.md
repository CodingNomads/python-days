# Python Training

This is the code repository for CodingNomads' 3-day Python Training. Each day introduces you to programming concepts and the Python language through
a practical and project-oriented approach.

Follow us [on Twitch](twitch.tv/codingnomads) and [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGA2DeCbZH4pTq7Mmh24-4A) for walk-through videos and
more content.

## Day 1 - Move Files With Python

Are there yet again 100+ screenshots on your Desktop? Don't worry, in this livestream you'll learn how to move many files on your computer at once using Python.
You'll see how knowing a bit of programming can make your daily life more fun and less repetitive. While building out a script to move and
rename files, you'll also get exposed to many important programming concepts through a practical approach.

### Concepts Covered

- Standard library and importing code
- Working with paths
- Objects and methods
- Iteration, `for` loop
- Lists and list comprehensions
- Strings
- Interacting with your file system
- `enumerate()`
- F-strings, string formatting, string mini-language
- Object attributes

By the end of day one you'll understand how you can use Python to automate tasks on your computer's file system. You'll know how to
move and rename files, and you'll have learned about important concepts in programming, such as variables, data types, control flow,
libraries, objects, and methods.

## Day 2 - Interface With APIs And Build A Website

Do you want to tap the infinite content available on the Internet? In this livestream you'll learn how to use Python to interact with Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs), which provide lots of free interesting information in formats that are made to be consumed by programs rather than
humans. You'll fetch image links and famous quotes from two different APIs and use that content to build your own webpage. While building this
project, you'll also learn about data formats used to transmit this information and how it translates to Python code, how to debug and inspect
your code, how to write to files and much more.

### Concepts Covered

- External libraries, `pip`, virtual environments
- Web interactions, interfacing with APIs
- Reading documentation
- GET requests
- JSON
- `breakpoint()` debugging
- Python collections: dictionaries and lists
- Advanced list comprehensions
- String methods
- `random` module
- Simple HTML
- Writing to files, `pathlib` revisited
- Running a server with Python's `http.server` on localhost

By the end of day two, you'll know how to use Python to automate making calls to free web APIs, receive content they offer,
and build your own simple webpage with that content.

## Day 3 - Build A Pokemon Game

Did you always want to write your own computer game? In this livestream you'll learn how to use a programming paradigm called _Object-Oriented Programming_
to model game entities and allow them to interact with each other. You'll build a tiny implementation of a Pokemon-like game that allows you
to create little creatures, feed them to gain health, and let them battle against each other.

### Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Game logic
- Instance methods
- `@staticmethod`
- Instance attributes, `self`
- Dunder methods: `__init__`, `__str__`
- `if __name__ == '__main__'`
- Importing your own code
- `breakpoint()` debugging

By the end of day three you'll understand the basics of object-oriented programming in Python and how you can apply them to
build a small game that you can play in your Python REPL.
